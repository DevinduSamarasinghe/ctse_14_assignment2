Configurations, 


1. VPCs - First Create the VPCs. Defaults do not work, when creating VPCs consider observation 13. 
2. Cluster - Creating the cluster with private subnets worked
3. Task Definition - Refer to the ctse-backend.json
4. Service - Refer to the Observation 13

How to remove a VPC
    Remove NAT Gateways 
    Remove Internet Gateway 
    Delete VPC

Observations 1: Failed
    Cluster:
        Created a VPC with 1 public and 1 private subnets 
        Created a cluster with private subnet only 
        Successfully identified the instance in the ASG group

    Service: 
        Service placement provides both private and public subnets, about to place it in the private;
            - Failed since there are no 2 subnets for the load balancer -> possible
        Service placement provides both private and public subnets, but cannot assign two subnets for one availability zone
            - Failed anyway because the cluster should be created with two different availability zones

Observation 2: Failed cause cluster has no public subnet to access
    VPC:
        Creating the VPC with 2 private and 2 public subnets. with one NAT gateway for 1 AZ. 

    Cluster: 
        Creating the Cluster with 2 private subnets.
    
    Service: 
        Creating the service by assigning two private subnets
        

Observation 3: Failed, because the public subnets have NAT gateways assigned, leading to lack of 
    VPC: 
        Same VPC with 2 subnets for private and public each with NAT gateway for 1 AZ

    Cluster:
        Creating a Cluster with 2 private
    
    Service: 
        Creating the service assigned to 2 public subnets instead 


Observation 4: Failed after second CICD - Because second availability zone has no NAT gateway
    VPC: Same VPC with 2 subnets for private and public each with NAT Gateway
    Cluster: Creating a cluster with 2 private subnets 
    Service: Creating a service assigned to 1 private and 1 public subnet in different availability zones

Observation 5: Both methods failed since NAT gateways are assigned to both, 2nd method broke cause of whitelist issue
    VPC: Creating VPC with 2 subnets for zone a,b with both private and public with NAT gateway for each availability zone
    Cluster: Creating a cluster with 2 private subnets 
    Service: Creating a service assigned to 2 private availability zones -> Failed
    Service config 2: Creating a service assigned to 1 private 1 public availability zones -> Failed

Observation 6: Failed, Doesnt identify the EC2 instances
    VPC: Creating a VPC with no Gateway
    Cluster: Creating a cluster with 2 private subnets
    Service: Creating a service assigned to 2 public availability zones 

Observation 7: Failed
    VPC: Creating a VPC with 2 private and 2 public with one NAT
    Cluster: Creating a cluster with 2 public subnets
    Service: Creating a service assigned to 1 public subnet

Observation 8: Failed - Issue resides with having no NAT gateway for south-b
    VPC: Creating a VPC with 2 private and 2 public with one NAT
    Cluster: Cluster with all subnets with public IP on for all
    Service: Creating a service with private subnet and public subnet (Not the NAT Gateway)


Observation 9: can be solved with a potential public on private cluster which runs on private service -> nat gateways on both publics
    VPC: 2 private 2 public NAT on both
    Cluster: 2 private with public IP on 
    service: running on those 2 privates 

Observation 10:
    VPC: 2 private 2 public one NAT 
    Cluster: Cluster with all subnets with public IP on for all
    Service: Creating a service assigned to 1 public 1 private

Observation 11: 
    VPC: 2 private 2 public one NAT 
    Cluster: Cluster with all subnets
    Service: Creating a service assigned to 1 public 1 private

Observation 12: Failed cause cluster does not have a public VPN.
    VPC: 2 private 2 public 2 NATs
    Cluster: 2 Private subnets 
    Service: Reside in 2 privates


Observation 13: Currently Working for both MongoDb and Internet 
    VPC: 2 Private 2 Public 1 NAT - Nat resides in ap-south-a
    Cluster: Created with both Private and Public subnets
             Adjusted the ASG group launch template to only trigger instantiations from ap-south-b
    Service: Reside in two subnets, private subnet - ap-south-b (same as the adjusted ASG subnet) public subnet - NAT gateway
