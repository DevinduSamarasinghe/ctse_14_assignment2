    Service: 
        Service placement provides both private and public subnets, about to place it in the private;
            - Failed since there are no 2 subnets for the load balancer -> possible
        Service placement provides both private and public subnets, but cannot assign two subnets for one availability zone
            - Failed anyway because the cluster should be created with two different availability zones
